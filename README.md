# Joint Reconstruction of Vascular Structure and Function Maps in Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI using


This is a source-code of the proposed method for joint reconstruction of DCE-MRI data to reproduce some of the results that are described in the paper: 
“Joint Reconstruction of Vascular Structure and Function Maps in Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI Using Vascular Heterogeneity Priors”

This code is not optimized and is provided for educational and research purposes.
If any publications result from the use of the software, please cite the software and the related papers.
